In Task 3: 


After reading the code in program "dns2proxy.py", there is a function named respuestas which I believe it is this function that changes the name to the IP. I could change this part to check for the query and if there is something in the query that we do not need like advertisments, we can answer by sending a fake IP. after this we have the line "save_req" which is to save the request in dnslog, and if the name of the request is in the blacklist then we wont let this line execute. Program dns2proxy_5.py uses this function to do filtering and has a part to prevent the names to save in dnslog.txt.


The complete blacklist can be found in the following. many of these addresses are found before visiting 6 web pages presented here and maybe more requests are blocked than named in the report list of these 6 websites. there maybe other junks that are not mentioned here because I was not sure about so many of these names. Although we can have a file to save this list in there and then read it after, here I saved the list in the main program so to have only one file.
